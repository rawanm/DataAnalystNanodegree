# Investigate a Dataset

In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.


For the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use Pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. You will not be required to use statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but you should make it clear in your communications that your findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.


## Dataset:
[Titanic Data](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/September/57e9a84c_titanic-data/titanic-data.csv) - Contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. You can view a description of this dataset on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) website, where the data was obtained.
