# Create a Tableau Story

For this project, you will create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

For the final project, you will create an explanatory data visualization from a data set that communicates a clear finding or that highlights relationships or patterns in a data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, and your final deliverable will be a write up along with a Tableau Public workbook.
